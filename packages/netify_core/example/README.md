# netify_core Example

This example demonstrates the core Netify functionality.

## Note

For real-world usage, you should use one of the adapter packages:

- **[netify_dio](https://pub.dev/packages/netify_dio)** - For Dio HTTP client
- **[netify_http](https://pub.dev/packages/netify_http)** - For dart:io http package

## Running the Example

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## What This Shows

This example shows the basic structure of netify_core, but doesn't demonstrate actual network inspection since that requires an HTTP client adapter.
